# Who am I?

I am Lizzie Ginther, a Master of Professional Writing student at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a passion for clear, user-centered communication. I received my undergraduate degree in English from University of California, Berkeley. My undergraduate education largely reinforced my interest in writing and the way that our consumption of information affects our everyday lives. After graduation, I moved to Dallas, Texas, where I worked as an employment-based immigration paralegal. In this role, I had the opportunity to work on numerous legal writing projects, and it inspired me to pursue a full-time career in writing. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, swimming, cooking new recipes, and trying new restaurants in my area. Reach out to elizabeth.ginther8@gmail.com if you would like to connect!
